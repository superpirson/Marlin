Greetings! Thank you for choosing Marlin 2 as your 3D printer firmware.

To configure Marlin you must edit Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h
located in the root 'Marlin' folder. Check the example_configurations folder to
see if there's a more suitable starting-point for your specific hardware.

Before diving in, we recommend the following essential links:

Marlin Firmware Official Website

  - http://marlinfw.org/
    The official Marlin Firmware website contains the most up-to-date
    documentation. Contributions are always welcome!

Configuration

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gwWVFtdg-4
    A good 20-minute overview of Marlin configuration by Tom Sanladerer.
    (Applies to Marlin 1.0.x, so Jerk and Acceleration should be halved.)
    Also... https://www.google.com/search?tbs=vid%3A1&q=configure+marlin

  - http://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/configuration.html
    Marlin's configuration options are explained in more detail here.

Getting Help
